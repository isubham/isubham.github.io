**** 18Oct 2022
***** Team Launch

- values and motivations
  why work on this project. what aspect of a project motivates you.

  for example -> when we started our first project trinetra. we wanted to work
  because there was a potential that it will get deployed on ranchi office, when
  that didn't happened. we just drifted to another. having our product deployed
  was the motivation.

- company vision
  what the team members think about the company. what it will do?

  for example -> when we started pitavya, we wanted to work with govt. but later on
  we decided to develop our our unique product, we worked on a contact tracing app
  for enclosed spaces, which didn't worked.

- working styles
  team members should inform about their work style in team settings and also
  commitments outside of work as well.

- roles and responsibilties
  each member should be assigned their at the start or on ad hoc basis based on skills.

*** Customer

- case study by Bil Aulet on customer focus
- different ways of market research
- prepare and perform customer interviews
- choosing customers

**** 19th Oct 2022

product start from customers so starting there is a good option, to find customer problems we need to do market research and from
that we will do customer interviews and then make the offering.

don't assume a problem and solve it later to find that either
the product that you build is either wrong or the problem is not big of a deal

Customer Interviews

https://youtu.be/Js4qoQp1Emo

increase the value of talking with the customer by
listen more than talk
asking how they are doing things now
asking how they wanna do things
asking what is stopping them
dont lead them to your solution

who you interview and how will you find them?
write interview guide, few open questions to learn about their needs
conduct interviews and write good notes

Methods of market research
- Interviews and observation
  early stage to know bring depth frustation and needs of user, and refine target customers for direct internet research and surveys more directed and valuable.
- internet research
  to help know the competition and size of market
- surveys
  to know key pointer for a product

- How to Interview
  - What NOT To Do
    Don’t come into a customer interview feeling you have the answers. If your idea doesn't adjust at least some based on these conversations, you're not listening.
    Don’t expect customers to have the answer. They'll know their frustrations and needs, but not necessarily how to solve it.
    Do not sell! This is the time to learn, so do NOT mention your specific ideas for how to solve the problem.
    Do not include friends and family in your interviews - you will not get as realistic perspective on the problems.

  - What To Do
    Focus on the need, not the solution!
    Beware of confirmation bias — you are NOT there to validate what you think, you are there to uncover a need.
    Do it in person, one at a time — this will allow you to pick up on cues from gestures and facial expressions.
    Ask open-ended questions — this makes it a conversation and allows you to get to more depth of the need you may not have thought about before.
    Get subjects to tell a story.
    Listen much more than you talk!
    Follow your nose and drill down (Why? Why?...).
    Understand their priorities..


afer market research sort the customer based on category, age, sex, spending habits.
identify that one person who has the biggest unmet demand who is most likely willing to spend money on a solution.
