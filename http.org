well it all started with computer available in the universities at first.

We had started implementing programs for them which enabled them to perform
useful things for its users.

The very first applications which would have written would have been operating systems
which would have just let the users run programs in their own devices, Much to this day
there are system which do that. The problem that they might have faced is sharing of
the output of those programs and that would have been happened with the use
of external storage devices.

They are all well and good if you have all the users residing in same location like a
office workspace but then users started sharing content across huge distances and
that would have happened with the help of FTP,
