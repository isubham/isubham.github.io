* Database Normalization

A process which eliminates anomalies and helps with data integrity.

there are several normal forms which helps to do that.

consider for example

Purchases1
| customer__name | phone | customer__address | item_name         |      item price | item quanitity |
|---------------+--------------+------------------+-------------------+-----------------+----------------|
| AppleSoyboy   |         4000 | street 102, jh   | [ipad, macbook]   | [20000, 100000] |         [2, 1] |
| LinuxChad     |         5000 | street 103, jh   | headphone 350     |            4000 |              1 |
| LinuxChad     |         5000 | street 103, jh   | HP laptop charger |            3000 |              2 |

if we want to update the address of
suresh then it can happen that we only update the first one "headpones 350"
and not "HP Laptop Charger One" so due to duplication of data of suresh
in both order we would have to update every one of them and it
can get missed this is _updation anomally_.

if we want to delete the ramesh details, but that would also delete the order of ramesh
as we only have 1 entry of him so this is deletion anomally in which deleting something
results in deletion of unintended data.

Normal forms

*1st Normal Form*

every field in the row should be atomic meaning no multi-values.

we should be able to uniquely identify each row

so by removing multivalue and addinng a primary key we have removed multi-values field as well as uniquely define each row.

Purchases2
| PurchaseID | customer_name | customer_phone | customer_address | item_name         | item_price | item_quantity | Purchase Amount |
|------------+---------------+----------------+------------------+-------------------+------------+---------------+-----------------|
|          1 | AppleSoyBoy   |           4000 | street 102, jh   | ipad              |      20000 |             2 |           41000 |
|          2 | AppleSoyBoy   |           4000 | street 102, jh   | macbook           |     100000 |             1 |          110000 |
|          3 | LinuxChad     |           5000 | street 103, jh   | headphone 350     |       4000 |             1 |            4300 |
|          4 | LinuxChad     |           5000 | street 103, jh   | HP laptop charger |       3000 |             2 |            3200 |



*2nd normal form*

functional dependency

composite keys should be only related to primary key 

So, we can see in Purchases2 table that customer_name, customer_address is dependent on customer_phone
so we can extract that in a separate relation,
likewise, item price depends on item_name so that can also be extracted out in a separate relation and we have


 Customers1
| Customer_Id | customer_phone | customer_name | customer_address |
|-------------+----------------+---------------+------------------|
|  1          |           4000 | AppleSoyBoy   | street 102, jh   |
|  2          |           5000 | LinuxChad     | street 103, jh   |

Item1
 | Item_Id | item              | item_price |
 |---------+-------------------+------------|
 |       1 | ipad              |      20000 |
 |       2 | macbook           |     100000 |
 |       3 | headphone 350     |       4000 |
 |       4 | HP laptop charger |       3000 |

Purchases3
 | PurchaseID | customer_id | item_id | item_quantity | Purchase Amount |
 |------------+-------------+---------+---------------+-----------------|
 |          1 |           1 |       1 |             1 |           41000 |
 |          2 |           1 |       2 |             1 |          110000 |
 |          3 |           2 |       3 |             3 |            4300 |
 |          4 |           2 |       4 |             2 |            3200 |

 *3rd normal form*

 should not have transitive functional dependency
