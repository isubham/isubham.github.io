*** why org-mode?

 i use
 - notion for taking notes
 - google calender for task management

 FRAGMENTATED SILOS
 all these different tools are sort of distracting because you have to use them differently and they all
 are not integrated

 DISTRACTION
 all these things are also connected to web browser which might be distracting at times

*** Basics

1. headlines using *,
   moving with alt + arrow keys,
   promotion with alt and arrow keys,
   and toggle with tab

2. list using +, -, 1, 2
   and end with M-enter, can move with alt and arrows just headings

   1. one
   2. two
   3. three
   4. four
      1. four one
      2. four two
	 1. four two 1
	 2. four two 2

3. Tables start with | and use Shift + Alt + arrow to generate and Alt + arrow to move

   |   |   | one |
   |---+---+-----|
   |   |   |     |
   |---+---+-----|
   |   |   |     |

4. Images: [[image-location] ] we can have images

5. Tasks

shift and arrow to create todo and cycle between states

we can split a task into multiple tasks by splitting them
and then adding [/] or [%] in the parent

*** Tasks [0/4] [0%]
**** TODO read shared page :zeeve:
DEADLINE: <2022-10-02 Sun> SCHEDULED: <2022-10-01 Sat>

**** TODO watch some youtube videos on blockchain :zeeve:
**** TODO Read the backend codebase for Platform :zeeve:
DEADLINE: <2022-10-02 Sun> SCHEDULED: <2022-10-02 Sun>

**** TODO solve 2 leetcode problems :dsa:
DEADLINE: <2022-10-01 Sat +1d>

6. checkboxes maybe create even smaller steps in tasks and they wont appear in global lists.
