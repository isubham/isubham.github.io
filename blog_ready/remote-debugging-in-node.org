* Remote Debugging in Node

When we say remote debugging what we generally mean is checking at log
messages, how system behave in a given input.

But after this article we will be able to do debugging as we do in our
local environment and that can be helpful if we have some dependencies
which are not available in our local machine, be it a cluster based like
kubernetes when you dont have liberty to deploy every single app on your
local machine or there was some case where you are not sure about the
behaviour,

Lets get started.

** Run server node process with --inpsect

So first thing we will have to do is run our node process with --inspect

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
node --inspect <script.js>
#+END_SRC

Node.js process will now listen to incoming debug clients. The debug clients
here we generally have is vscode when we try to debug our apps during development.

The port on which it listens is 9229.
So full url is ws://127.0.0.1:9229/9bea9c74-773d-4a36-804d-f2e2fba1c8a1

So let's run it in a project and assume it is server.

** SSH Port forwarding from local to remote

   Lets say we have a server details like subham@192.168.1.137.
   So ssh into that server with

   ssh -L 9221:localhost:9229  subham@192.168.1.137

   The 9229 is the same port that node.js process is listening on.
   So we forwarding 9221 of dev machine to 9229 or server.

** Configure local port pointed to remote 

    open

    chrome://inspect/#devices

    [[file:../img/chrome-inspect-tab.png]]

   Click on Open dedicated DevTools for Node
    
   [[file:../img/chrom-add-network-endpoint.png]]


   Click on add connection and add port of dev machine which is 9221.
   So that will be localhost:9221

Opening sources section will have the source code that we have in our server.

** Hit the Endpoint and Debug

Now to debug, we can fire request to that server and the debugger will be able to stop at that breakpoint.

   and we have
