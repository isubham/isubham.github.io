# Http

1990s CERN
A young scientist Tim Berners Lee was working at CERN? 

# WHY????????????????
when was it developed?
what problems were he facing at that time?
what were the existing solutions back then?
why did he developed HTTP?

Well internet came and with it we had lots of computer connected to it and only way we use to transfer 
information was Email.

the main users were esentially university and their students, businesses and their workflow


# Solution
==========
Hypertext transfer protocol was a protocol initally developed by Tim Berners Lee on 1990s.

it consisted of a 
1. http server
2. http client
3. html

## HTTP/1.0
first version of HTTP works on top of TCP as underlying transport layer protocol.

So client connects to server using TCP hanshake. a TCP connection is 
established which is a persistent, duplex connection. 

Client will try to access some URI, which is uniform resource identifier.

Q. explain URL and URI?

HTML is basically a object, DOM. it can have nested object like images, scripts, css etc.

for every nested object the client will again a TCP connection and get the resource from
server.

This can lead to lots of TCP connections for single webpage.


## HTTP/1.1

it introduced utilizing single connection for fetching multiple objects and they all can 
be requested parallely (pipeling)

## HTTP/2.0

multiplexing was introduced which improved the perceived latency of 
loading the webpage.
what happens is the requests was interweived in a single frame so does the response
